### Project Name: Pizza Menu

# The project was built during React course of Jonas Schmedtmann

# Project Description:

This is a small React project that demonstrates the following concepts:

Components
Adding inline CSS
Adding external CSS
Using props
Rendering lists
Reusing components
Conditional rendering of classes, text, and elements
Destructuring props
Strict mode
React fragment

# Technologies Used:

React
JavaScript
CSS

# Approach:

This project was built using a component-based approach. Each component represents a specific part of the pizza menu, such as the header, the list of pizzas, and the order form. The components are composed together to create the complete pizza menu.

The project also uses inline and external CSS to style the pizza menu. Inline CSS is used to style individual components, while external CSS is used to style the overall layout of the menu.

Props are used to pass data between components. For example, the PizzaList component receives a prop containing the list of pizzas to display.

Conditional rendering is used to display different content based on certain conditions. For example, the OrderForm component is only displayed if the user has added at least one pizza to their order.

Destructuring props is used to extract individual values from props. For example, the PizzaListItem component destructures the pizza prop to extract the pizza's name, price, and image URL.

Strict mode is used to enable additional checks and warnings that can help to prevent bugs.

React fragment is used to group together multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM.
